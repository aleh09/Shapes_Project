# Shapes Project

## Purpose
To create a series of classes to represent simple 2D and 3D
shapes. The classes use inheritance & polymorphism to store and use separate classes.
Some classes make use of multiple inheritance, as well as private inheritance. The program 
provides a menu-based user interface that allows the user to create lists of 2D and 3D shapes
and perform actions on those lists.
